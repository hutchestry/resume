         <!-- Introduction --> 
	  <p>Hi, I'm Scott Hutchison, Graphic Designer &amp; Web Designer. But I guess you know that already. I've been doing this stuff since 1998 when I self published a little magazine while in college. I was a literature and journalism student back then, but I got hip to the web along the way and have been banging out beautiful code instead of verse ever since. And coming up with amazing design solutions!</p>
            <p>I've worked for alternative weeklies, online publications and, in the past 2 years or so, for a large company in the Southeast designing, maintaining and pwning a large intranet and external website. I also work the freelance angle, so if you need a logo, website, brochure,  some maintenance or help with your website or marketing campaign, get in touch!</p>
